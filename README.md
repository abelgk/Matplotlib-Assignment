Pyber - The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.
Objectives:
Showcase the relationship between four key variables:
    Average Fare ($) Per City
    Total Number of Rides Per City
    Total Number of Drivers Per City
    City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

Three pie charts:

    % of Total Fares by City Type
    % of Total Rides by City Type
    % of Total Drivers by City Type
Below are some of the notable trends:
•	We can observe that Urban city types charge the highest fares in comparison to Rural and Suburban city types
•	We can also observe that the highest number of rides are hired in Urban city types (68% of the total rides from our sample data)
•	the other observation we can gather from the data is that Urban city drivers also account for the highest share in comparison to Rural and Suburban city types.
